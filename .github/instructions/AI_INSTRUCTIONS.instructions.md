1-Record a modification plan: Before applying any changes, write a detailed, step-by-step plan of what you will do in the TODO file. This clarifies the workflow and helps track progress. Avoid over-planning for features not explicitly requested or future enhancements that weren't asked for.
2-Use TypeScript and Next.js framework: Always use TypeScript for all code files and Next.js.
3-Use only Tailwind CSS for styling - no other CSS frameworks or custom CSS files.
4-Create a detailed plan: Spend time developing a thorough plan for the AI to follow, including edge cases, to ensure the app behaves as expected.
5-Utilize rules: Implement rules to guide the AI in writing code according to your preferences, structure, and workflow.
6-Write tests: Write tests along the way to ensure that the code works as expected.
7-Develop one feature at a time: Focus on building one feature at a time for better code management.
8-Use chat mode: Switch to chat mode to ask questions and leverage the AI's knowledge with the context of your codebase.
9-Use free templates: Use free templates to build beautiful front ends.
10-Specify code parts for updates: Direct the AI to specific code sections for updates or fixes using the "@" symbol.
11-Learn best practices: Familiarize yourself with coding best practices to enhance code maintainability and security.
12-Refactor code: Ask the AI to refactor code for conciseness, modularity, and to avoid code duplication
13-Perform security audits: Request the AI to conduct security audits to identify vulnerabilities in your code.
14-Avoid sharing API keys: Never publicly share API keys to prevent unauthorized use.
15-Use MCP servers: Experiment with MCP servers to give your agents additional tools.
16-Ensure you test new features after adding them, especially using browser use mcp if necessary.
17-Include app structure in README: Document the application's directory structure, components, and architecture in the README file to help new developers understand the codebase organization quickly.
18-Use Execute command from Desktop Commander MCP: Utilize the Execute command feature from Desktop Commander MCP to run commands when needed, rather than using Copilot's original terminal functionality.
19-Follow conversation instructions first: Always prioritize and follow the specific instructions given in the current conversation before applying any other guidelines.
20-Adhere to README instructions: After following conversation instructions, refer to and follow the instructions documented in the README file.
21-Do not add unauthorized features: Avoid adding any features or functionality that are not explicitly requested or mentioned in the conversation or documentation.
22-Do not run the project automatically: Never start or run the project unless explicitly requested to do so.
23-Clarify ambiguous requests: If a programmer's request is unclear, has multiple interpretations, or you identify better alternatives, don't hesitate to ask for clarification or suggest alternative approaches before proceeding.
24-Suggest improvements when beneficial: If you notice potential improvements or identify approaches that could harm the project, proactively communicate these concerns and propose better solutions.
25-Ask questions for better outcomes: When in doubt about requirements or implementation details, ask specific questions to ensure the best possible solution is delivered.
26-English-only interface: Maintain English-only user interface and content (Arabic support is planned for future implementation).
27-Follow exact project structure: Always adhere to the exact directory structure and organization defined in DEVELOPMENT.md file.
28-Use dedicated tests folder: All testing scripts, API tests, setup scripts, and integration tests must be placed in the `/tests` folder to maintain organization and separation of concerns.
