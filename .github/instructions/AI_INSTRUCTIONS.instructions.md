1. **Record a modification plan:** Before applying any changes, write a detailed, step-by-step plan of what you will do in the TODO file. This clarifies the workflow and helps track progress. Avoid over-planning for features not explicitly requested or future enhancements that weren't asked for.
2. **Use only Tailwind CSS for styling:** No other CSS frameworks or custom CSS files.
3. **Create a detailed plan:** Spend time developing a thorough plan for the AI to follow, including edge cases, to ensure the app behaves as expected.
4. **Utilize rules:** Implement rules to guide the AI in writing code according to your preferences, structure, and workflow.
5. **Write tests:** Write tests along the way to ensure that the code works as expected.
6. **Develop one feature at a time:** Focus on building one feature at a time for better code management.
7. **Use chat mode:** Switch to chat mode to ask questions and leverage the AI's knowledge with the context of your codebase.
8. **Use free templates:** Use free templates to build beautiful front ends.
9. **Learn best practices:** Familiarize yourself with coding best practices to enhance code maintainability and security.
10. **Refactor code:** Ask the AI to refactor code for conciseness, modularity, and to avoid code duplication.
11. **Perform security audits:** Request the AI to conduct security audits to identify vulnerabilities in your code.
12. **Avoid sharing API keys:** Never publicly share API keys to prevent unauthorized use.
13. **Include app structure in README:** Document the application's directory structure, components, and architecture in the README file to help new developers understand the codebase organization quickly.
14. **Follow conversation instructions first:** Always prioritize and follow the specific instructions given in the current conversation before applying any other guidelines.
15. **Adhere to README instructions:** After following conversation instructions, refer to and follow the instructions documented in the README file.
16. **Do not add unauthorized features:** Avoid adding any features or functionality that are not explicitly requested or mentioned in the conversation or documentation.
17. **Clarify ambiguous requests:** If a programmer's request is unclear, has multiple interpretations, or you identify better alternatives, don't hesitate to ask for clarification or suggest alternative approaches before proceeding.
18. **Suggest improvements when beneficial:** If you notice potential improvements or identify approaches that could harm the project, proactively communicate these concerns and propose better solutions.
19. **Ask questions for better outcomes:** When in doubt about requirements or implementation details, ask specific questions to ensure the best possible solution is delivered.
20. **English-only interface:** Maintain English-only user interface and content (Arabic support is planned for future implementation).
21. **Follow exact project structure:** Always adhere to the exact directory structure and organization defined in DEVELOPMENT.md file.
22. **Use dedicated tests folder:** All testing scripts, API tests, setup scripts, and integration tests 23.must be placed in the `/tests` folder to maintain organization and separation of concerns.
23. **Enforce Root Directory Structure:** Ensure all project files reside strictly within the project root directory. The file structure must align with:
    project-root/
    ├── src/ # Contains all source code and assets
    ├── DEVELOPMENT.instructions.md
    ├── TODO.instructions.md
    └── README.md
